### CNCF ServiceDesk access

The CNCF ServiceDesk policy for Kubernetes community is defined at [ServiceDesk](operations/service-desk.md).

## Top-level Accounts

The steering committee delegates ownership of various Kubernetes community accounts like GitHub, domain names, etc to SIGs and sub-projects. However, the committee also reserves top-level account access for service governance in some cases.
