# Process for Contributor Recommendation Letters

The Kubernetes Steering Committee is committed to supporting the dedicated
contributors who drive our project forward. We are often asked to provide
letters of recommendation or statements of contribution for purposes such as
visa applications, immigration proceedings, or professional recognition.

This document outlines a formal, consistent, and scalable process for handling
these requests. Its purpose is to enable the Steering Committee to provide
meaningful support while upholding the integrity and accuracy of any statement
made on behalf of the Kubernetes project.

## Roles and Responsibilities

* **Applicant:** The Kubernetes contributor requesting the letter. They are
responsible for initiating the request, drafting the letter, and obtaining peer
verification.

* **Peer Verifier:** A recognized technical leader (e.g., Tech Lead, subproject
owner, or maintainer) from the SIGs or subprojects where the applicant has
contributed. They are responsible for reviewing the applicant's draft letter for
factual accuracy.

* **Steering Committee:** The committee is collectively responsible for the
process. Members individually review submitted materials, ask for clarification
if needed, and provide their signature to signify approval. The collective
signatures constitute the official endorsement.

## The Process

### Step 1: Request Initiation

The Applicant sends their initial request to the Steering Committee's official
contact point: steering-private@kubernetes.io.

### Step 2: Applicant Submits Materials

The Steering Committee responds with this process (see Appendix A for a
template). The Applicant is then responsible for submitting the following
materials to the committee:

1. **A draft of the recommendation letter.**
1. **Evidence of Peer Verification:** This should be confirmation from at least
one (ideally two) Peer Verifiers who have reviewed the draft. Confirmation can
be in the form of a forwarded email or another verifiable message.

### Step 3: Committee Review, Signature, and Delivery
Upon receiving the materials, each committee member individually reviews the
draft letter and the peer verification.

* If a member has questions or requires clarification, they should raise them
directly with the Applicant, copying the committee mailing list for transparency.

* Members who are satisfied with the letter's accuracy and tone proceed to sign
the document.

* The letter is considered officially approved once the required supermajority
has signed it.
