# Kubernetes Steering Committee Charter

This document outlines the mission, scope, and objectives of the Kubernetes
Steering Committee.

## Mission

The Kubernetes Steering Committee is the governing body of the Kubernetes
project, providing decision-making and oversight pertaining to the Kubernetes
project bylaws, sub-organizations, and financial planning.  The Steering 
Committee also defines the project values and structure.

## How

* Adapt the role and structure of the Steering Committee as needed to meet the
  needs of the project.
* Responsibilities not explicitly delegated to other
  parties<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> through their charters reside with
  the Steering Committee.
* All management<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> responsibilities should be delegated to other
  parties<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.
* All technical responsibilities should be delegated to SIGs (i.e. the SC shouldn't
  retain technical responsibilities itself).

## Direct responsibilities of the Steering Committee

The following responsibilities belong directly to the Steering Committee.

* Through the chartering review process, delegate ownership of, responsibility for
  and authority over areas of the project to specific entities<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.
* Define, evolve, and defend the non-technical vision / mission and the values
  of the project.
* Charter and refine policy for defining new community groups<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>,
  and establish transparency and accountability policies for such groups
* Define and evolve project and group<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> governance
  structures and policies<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>.
* Act as a final non-technical escalation point for any Kubernetes repository<sup>[5](#footnote5)</sup>.
* Request funds and other support from the CNCF (e.g. marketing, press, etc.)
* Define and enforce requirements for community groups<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>
  to be in good standing such as having an approved charter.

### Not yet delegated responsibilities

The following responsibilities belong to the Steering Committee, but may be delegated in the future.

* Coordinate with the CNCF regarding usage of the Kubernetes brand and deciding
  which things can be called “Kubernetes”, as well as how that mark can be used
  in relation to other efforts or vendors.
* Decide, for the purpose of elections, who is a member of standing of the
  Kubernetes project, and what privileges that entails.
* Control and delegate access to and establish processes regarding
  any Kubernetes repository<sup>[5](#footnote5)</sup> 
* Control and delegate access to and establish processes regarding
  project resources/assets<sup>[6](#footnote6)</sup>  

## Quorum

Steering committee members are generally expected to attend every meeting. We
use the following guidelines to determine whether we have reached quorum and
are able to proceed with a meeting.

* Round quorum up if total number of members is odd
* Quorum to meet is 1/2 members attending (eg: 6/12, 6/11, 4/7)
* Quorum to vote in a meeting is 2/3 members attending (eg: 8/12, 8/11, 5/7)

## Inclusive Leadership Training

Members of the committee must take an
[Inclusive Open Source Community Orientation course](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/inclusive-open-source-community-orientation-lfc102/)
in support of our community values.  Members are required to report
completion of the course as part of on-boarding within 30 days from
the date of their appointment.
